            <li><em>Perennials</em></li>
            <p>These flowers live and flower for multiple years. Eg <a href="https://pixabay.com/images/search/coneflowers/" target="_blank" title="Get more images here">coneflowers</a></p>

        <h2>How to care for flowers if you have any</h2>
        <h3>Let's look into that</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Trim the stem</em></li>
            <p>Cut 1-2 inches off at a 45 degrees angle before placing them in water. This helps with water absorbtion.</p>
            <li><em>Use clean vase and fresh water</em></li>
            <p>Always use a clean vase and use room temperature water and change it every 2-3 days.</p>
            <li><em>Avoid sunlight</em></li>
            <p>Avoid direct sunlight, heat, or drafts. Flowers can last longer in cool places.</p>
