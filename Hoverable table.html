        <h1>ANC HOME VISITS</h1>
        <!--use a pregnant's woman as background image-->
        <!--add links too-->
        <p>ANC stands for Antenatal Care, it is the routine health care provided for pregnant women
            during pregnancy to ensure the heath and well being of the mother and unborn baby.
            Most women in the rural areas do not have direct access to the hospital for the regular ANC visits.<br>
            A CHPS (Community-based Health Planning and Services) compound has been stationed in these rural communities to have access for these visits.<br>
            Home Visits are done by the health workers in the CHPS componds to provide quality health Services to the community. 
        </p>
         <p>Below is a table showing some visits done and the activities that took place.</p>
